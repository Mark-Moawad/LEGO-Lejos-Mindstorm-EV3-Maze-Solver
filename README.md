# Projects
A repository containing most of the major projects I did myself, or participated in
//This project contains a code for a Maze Solving LEGO Lejos Mindstorms EV3 robot, where the robot sets its orientation using a gyroscope sensor, detects obstacles using an Ultrasonic sensor, and detects colors using color sensor.
//The aim is to make the robot reach a goal (wall of a specific color), starting from any arbitrary position in a closed grid map of 35*35 cm^2 tiles, following the algorithm of "Left first".
